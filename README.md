# FFXIV Mini Cactpot Guesser
An app to guess the best solution for the Mini Cactpot game in Final Fantasy XIV.

## Game Rules
Every ticket has nine spaces, each numbered randomly from one to nine. At the start, however, eight of these nine spaces will be hidden. To begin, select three numbers from the eight hidden on your ticket.

Next, select one of eight linesâ”€vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. When selecting a line, the sum of the three numbers in that line will determine the amount of points you receive.

After you have selected a line, all the numbers are uncovered and you will receive points based on the sum of the line you chose.
